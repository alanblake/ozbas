How to setup SQL-Ledger for reporting

= Introduction =

All thats required is for the relevant BAS codes G1,G11,G14 etc to be linked to the appropriate COA


= Details =

 Add the relevant bas code as a GIFI code to each Chart.  

 enter (G1) as the GIFI code for  Sales

 * (G11) Purchases
 * (G11)(G14) Purchases - FRE   
 * (W1) Wages


Because G14 is included in the G11 total its important to have both codes.
The bas code must be UPPER CASE and be enclosed in ()  like (G1)
